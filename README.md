Adding New Themes
=================
There are a few ways to upload themes to WordPress, you can read about all of them [here][1], but one simple way is:

1.  Download theme and and create a ZIP file of the theme on your local computer.
2.  Inside your WordPress admin menu (standalone) or network admin menu (MultiSite) go to the Install Themes panel and click on "Upload".
3.  Choose your ZIP file and press "Install Now".

Install the Theme Updater Plugin
================================
This theme utilizes the [Theme Updater Plugin][2] to push update notifications directly to your WordPress site.
